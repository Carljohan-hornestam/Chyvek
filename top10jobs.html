                    Initially, the representatives of this profession have to make the lives of restroom visitors
                    comfortable, but it turns out they are just an obstacle. A restroom attendant is from the so-called
                    list of jobs for people who don’t know what to do. Having no special skills, knowledge, or
                    experience often pushes people to apply for this awkward position. All they do is sitting daylong
                    and making sure the visitors obey the silly rules. Oh, and one more thing: they have to pick money
                    for each visitor. That is just so unfair that an average citizen cannot attend the WC having any
                    money in the pocket. What is he or she supposed to do? Pretend there are no restroom attendants in
                    the world. Would you miss the experience of having a stranger squirt soap in your hands or share a
                    toilet paper?

                    employees. Oh, and customers do terrible things to the restrooms. And throw trash all over the
                    parking lot.

                    There are many unpleasant aspects of being a pest control worker. Beyond dealing with roaches, rats,
                    termites, and more, pest control workers must often bend and crawl their way into tight spaces to
                    search for and eliminate pests. Many of these workers also must use pesticides, which are toxic and
                    can be extremely harmful if not handled properly.

                    Many call centers require you to take over 100 calls a day. You are measured and micro managed on
                    various ( KPI’s ) Key Performance Indicators. All calls are recorded. You are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Having an off day can get you in trouble. Some of the worst call centers limit toilet breaks via various methods including a limited number of toilet cards. You are often required to lie to customers about the real reasons something has went wrong / not working again and again.Some customers think the phone is a free for all for a lack of social graces.
                    In the end many people working there just burn out.

                    From verrucas to ingrown toenails, chiropodists make it their business to fix feet. Which is all
                    very well, but we can only imagine some of the smells and sights they’re faced with on a day-to-day
                    basis. Some overcome the smell issue with a slick of vapour rub under the nose. Sadly, it’s not so
                    easy to stop yourself from seeing the feet. Unless you close your eyes, which is never a good idea
                    when you’re holding a scalpel and a stranger’s foot.

                    As a dishwasher, your hands are never dry. All day long, you are left battling with cutlery and
                    crockery in the kitchen. Dishwashers have the tragedy of dealing with sick pay, too; this makes the
                    job even more frustrating. Utensils keep piling up with every new order, and the work seems endless.
                    It is one of those jobs that many people just wish didn’t exist.

                    It's devastating, time consuming, expensive and inevitable. Parents know that one day their children
                    will contract lice and bring them home. Treatment and cleaning costs parents time off from work,
                    extra money and a headache. However, those little creepy, crawly bugs don't stand a chance against
                    the head lice patrol. Technicians delouse your child's hair, steam clean the home, and provide
                    preventive advice.

                    Butchers have the grisly task of preparing meat for human consumption. Health standards and metrics
                    lead to job stress. There are also workplace hazards involved with all the sharp cleavers and knives
                    laying around.
